Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.

Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.

The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.

They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .

Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.

Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.

The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.

They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .

Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.
Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.
The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

Euclid's  <START:entity> Elements <END>  has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.
First set in type in  <START:entity> Venice <END>  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by  <START:entity> Carl Benjamin Boyer <END>  to be second only to the  <START:entity> Bible <END>  in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.
For centuries, knowledge of at least part of the  <START:entity> Elements <END>  was required of all students.

The  <START:entity> Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno <END>  ( <START:entity> BFGS <END> ) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.
However,  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  has proven to have good performance even for non-smooth optimizations.
<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.

Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  method approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function.
For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero.
Newton's method and the  <START:entity> BFGS <END>  methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum.
These methods use both the first and second derivatives of the function.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.

The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.

They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .

Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .

<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .

<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.

 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

<START:entity> Montgomery Castle <END>  is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in  <START:entity> Powys <END> ,  <START:entity> Wales <END> .
It is one of many Norman castles on the border between  <START:entity> Wales <END>  and  <START:entity> England <END> .
The original castle was built at the order of  <START:entity> Roger de Montgomery <END> , earl of  <START:entity> Shrewsbury <END>  sometime between 1071 and 1074.
On the rebellion of his son  <START:entity> Robert of Belleme <END>  in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers.
In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where  <START:entity> King Henry III <END>  granted  <START:entity> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd <END>  the title of  <START:entity> Prince of Wales <END> .
After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.
The  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  mechanism is an ancient analog computer designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the cycles of  <START:entity> Olympic Games <END> .
Found housed in a 340 × 180 × 90 mm wooden box, the device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears.
Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.
The largest gear is approximately 140 mm in diameter.
The artifact was recovered in 1901 from the  <START:entity> Antikythera <END>  shipwreck off the Greek island of  <START:entity> Antikythera <END> .
Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been dated either between 150 to 100 BC or, according to a more recent view, at 205 BC.
Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms.
They occasionally come onto shore to mate.
They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer.
In recent years, a decline in the population has occurred as a consequence of coastal habitat destruction in  <START:entity> Japan <END>  and overharvesting along the east coast of  <START:entity> North America <END> .
Because of their origin 450 million years ago (Mya), horseshoe crabs are considered living fossils.
Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but belong to a separate subphylum, and are closely related to arachnids.
The earliest horseshoe crab fossils are found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 Mya.
A differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus.
Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas.
One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply.
If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.
<START:entity> Sun Microsystems <END> , Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information technology services and that created the Java programming language and the Network File System (NFS).
<START:entity> Sun <END>  significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.
<START:entity> Sun <END>  was founded on February 24, 1982.
On January 27, 2010,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was acquired by  <START:entity> Oracle Corporation <END>  for US $7.4 billion.
The following month,  <START:entity> Sun <END>  was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.
 <START:entity> Apollo 11 <END>  was the spaceflight that landed the first humans on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> , Americans  <START:entity> Neil Armstrong <END>  and  <START:entity> Buzz Aldrin <END> , on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later.
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The third member of the mission,  <START:entity> Michael Collins <END> , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to  <START:entity> Earth <END> .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on  <START:entity> Earth <END> ; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the  <START:entity> Moon <END> .
After being sent toward the  <START:entity> Moon <END>  by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the  <START:entity> Sea of Tranquility <END> .
They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface.
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to  <START:entity> Earth <END>  and landed in the  <START:entity> Pacific Ocean <END>  on July 24.
<START:entity> James Clerk Maxwell <END>  was a Scottish mathematical physicist.
His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by        
 <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END> ... Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.
Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.
The unification     of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.
His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics.
His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of  <START:entity> Isaac Newton <END>  and  <START:entity> Albert Einstein <END> .
